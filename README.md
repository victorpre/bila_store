A tiny and quick project written in Elixir (Phoenix) that was written in order to provide me a way to display all the things that I selling before moving.


## Development
To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`
 Â * Create an admin user with: `BilaStore.Auth.create_user(%{username: "username", password: "password"})`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/deployment).

## Contributing
Feel free to fork the project and contribute if you have any ideas. But again, this was made just for fun. Use as you want.
